   Deprecate Modification of 'secure' cookies from non-secure origins
                 draft-west-leave-secure-cookies-alone

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6265 by removing the ability for a non-
   secure origin to set cookies with a 'secure' flag, and to overwrite
   cookies whose 'secure' flag is set.  This deprecation improves the
   isolation between HTTP and HTTPS origins, and reduces the risk of
   malicious interference.

1.  Introduction

   Section 8.5 and Section 8.6 of [RFC6265] spell out some of the
   drawbacks of cookies' implementation: due to historical accident,
   non-secure origins can set cookies which will be delivered to secure
   origins in a manner indistinguishable from cookies set by that origin
   itself.  This enables a number of attacks, which have been recently
   spelled out in some detail in [COOKIE-INTEGRITY].

   We can mitigate the risk of these attacks by making it more difficult
   for non-secure origins to influence the state of secure origins.
   Accordingly, this document recommends the deprecation and removal of
   non-secure origins' ability to write cookies with a 'secure' flag,
   and their ability to overwrite cookies whose 'secure' flag is set
   with a non-secure variant.

2.  Terminology and notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Recommendations

   This document updates Section 5.3 of [RFC6265] as follows:

   1.  After step 8 of the current algorithm, which sets the cookie's
       "secure-only-flag", execute the following step:

       1.  If the "scheme" component of the "request-uri" is not
           "https", and the cookie's "secure-only-flag" is "true", then
           abort these steps and ignore the newly created cookie
           entirely.

   2.  Before step 3 of step 11 of the current algorithm, execute the
       following step:

       1.  If the "scheme" component of the "request-uri" is not
           "https", and the "old-cookie"'s "secure-only-flag" is set,
           then abort these steps and ignore the newly create cookie
           entirely.
