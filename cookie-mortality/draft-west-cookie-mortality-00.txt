        Increase Mortality Rate for Non-secure Origins' Cookies
                  draft-west-cookie-mortality-rate-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6265 with the goal of increasing the rate at
   which cookies set from non-secure origins are evicted from the cookie
   store.

1.  Introduction

   Something something user agents, powerful features, and secure
   transport (see [SECURE-CONTEXTS], [POWERFUL-FEATURES], and
   [DEPRECATING-HTTP]).

   Something something NSA [NSA-COOKIES].

   Something something pervasive monitoring [RFC7258].

1.1.  Example

   Assume "http://example.com/" sends the following header in 2016
   (attempting to set a cookie which expires after a few years):

   Set-Cookie: A=B; expires=Thu, 31-Dec-2020 01:01:01 GMT;

   This header will result in the creation of a cookie named "A" that
   expires either when the user agent determines that "the current
   session is over" (see Section 5.3 of [RFC6265]), or after XXX has
   passed.

   If "https://example.com/" had sent the same header, the cookie would
   be stored with the desired expiration date (though the browser would
   still be free to remove it earlier than that as discussed in
   Section 7.3 of [RFC6265].

2.  Terminology and notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Recommendations

   This document updates Section 5.3 of [RFC6265] as follows:

   1.  Add a new field to each cookie: "created-from-secure-context".

   2.  After step 9 of the current algorithm (which finishes setting the
       current cookie fields), execute the following steps:

       1.  If the origin of 'request-uri' is not "potentially
           trustworthy" [SECURE-CONTEXTS]:

           1.  Set the cookie's "created-from-secure-context" flag to
               "false".

           2.  Set the cookie's "persistent-flag" to "false".

           3.  If the cookie's "expiry-time" is more than XXX in the
               future, set the cookie's "expiry-time" to the current
               date and time, plus XXX.

           Otherwise:

           1.  Set the cookie's "created-from-secure-context" to "true".

   3.  Change the eviction order at the bottom of the section to ensure
       that cookies whose "created-from-secure-context" flag is "true"
       are evicted only after all cookies whose "created-from-secure-
       context" flag is "false".

4.  Implementation Considerations

4.1.  Expiring Session Cookies

   User agents may currently assume that it isn't possible to have both
   a meaningful "expiry-time" and "persistent-flag" of "false".  Chrome,
   for instance, toggles a cookie's "IsPersistent" property by checking
   that "!expiry_date_.is_null()".  To implement the recommendations
   here, these flags should be accessible independently.
