                             Cookie Sorting
                      draft-west-cookie-sorting-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6265 by redefining the expected order in
   which cookies are listed in the "Cookie" header.  The new sort order
   augments the preference for the "most specific" cookie by taking
   cookie attributes into account, giving servers not only the "most
   specific" but also the "most authoritative" cookies first.

1.  Introduction

   In the beginning, there were two rules for cookie ordering in step 2
   of Section 5.4 of [RFC6265]:

      The user agent SHOULD sort the cookie-list in the following order:



      *  Cookies with longer paths are listed before cookies with
         shorter paths.

      *  Among cookies that have equal-length path fields, cookies with
         earlier creation-times are listed before cookies with later
         creation-times.

   The lax rules in this ordering are good for compatability, but we
   could improve their security properties.  For instance, we could make
   cookie stuffing [GitHub2013] significantly less effective if we
   ensured that the most specific, and most authoritaive cookies for a
   particular URI were consistently listed before less reliable, less
   specific cookies.

   Here, we treat cookies set by the root of a host as being more
   authoritative than those set by leafs, and lay out a set of rules
   that attempts to ensure that this ordering is clearly specified.

2.  Terminology and notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Sorting

   This document updates Section 5.4 of [RFC6265] by replacing step 2 of
   the current "cookie-string" generation algorthm with the following:

3.1.  New Step 2

   The user agent MUST sort "cookie-list" in decending order, according
   to the following comparison algorithm which, given two cookies, "A"
   and B, returns "greater" if "A" is greater than B, and "lesser" if B
   is greater than "A".

   NOTE: This algorithm produces a strict total ordering of "cookie-
   list" as the requirements in Section 5.3 of [RFC6265] ensure that no
   two cookies can be equal under the following rules.

   1.  If "A"'s "domain" attribute is equal in length to "B"'s "domain"
       attribute:

       1.  If "A"'s "host-only-flag" is set, and "B"'s "host-only-flag"
           is not set, return "greater" (as these cookies could not be
           set by a subdomain, and are therefore more authoritative for
           the "request-host").

       2.  If "A"'s "http-only-flag" is set, and "B"'s "http-only-flag"
           is not set, return "greater" (as these cookies can only be
           set by the server, not by XSS, and are therefore more
           authoritative for the "request-host").

       3.  If "A"'s "path" attribute is equal in length to "B"'s "path"
           attribute:

           1.  If "A"'s "secure-only-flag" is set, and "B"'s "secure-
               only-flag" is not set, return "greater" (as secure
               cookies are unlikely to be the result of meddling
               middleboxes).

           2.  If "A"'s "creation-date" is prior to "B"'s "creation-
               date", return "greater".

           3.  Return "lesser".

           Otherwise:

           1.  Return "greater" if "A"'s "path" attribute is longer than
               "B"'s "domain" attribute.

               Otherwise return "lesser".

       Otherwise:

       1.  Return "greater" if "A"'s "domain" attribute is longer than
           "B"'s "domain" attribute.

           Otherwise, return "lesser".

4.  Authoring Considerations

   It is entirely possible that this ordering is incompatible with the
   web.  In particular, applications may depend on existing ordering
   which privileges both the most recently set cookies, and the cookies
   which have the most specific path.  Experimentation is required to
   determine whether or not a change is at all possible.
