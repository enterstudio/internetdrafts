                          First-Party Cookies
                   draft-west-first-party-cookies-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6265, defining the "First-Party" attribute
   for cookies, which allows servers to mitigate the risk of cross-site
   request forgery attacks by asserting that a particular cookie should
   only be sent in a "first-party" context.

1.  Introduction

   Section 8.2 of [RFC6265] eloquently notes that cookies are a form of
   ambient authority, attached by default to requests the user agent
   sends on a user's behalf.  Even when an attacker doesn't know the
   contents of a user's cookies, she can still execute commands on the
   user's behalf (and with the user's authority) by asking the user
   agent to send HTTP requests to unwary servers.

   Here, we update [RFC6265] with a simple mitigation strategy that
   allows servers to declare certain cookies as "First-party cookies"
   which should be attached to requests if and only if they occur in a
   first-party context.

   Note that the mechanism outlined here is backwards compatible with
   the existing cookie syntax.  Servers may serve first-party cookies to
   all user agents; those that do not support the "First-Party"
   attribute will simply store a non-first-party cookie, just as they do
   today.

1.1.  Examples

   First-party cookies are set via the "First-Party" attribute in the
   "Set-Cookie" header field.  That is, given a server's response to a
   user agent which contains the following header field:

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; First-Party

Internet-Draft             first-party-cookies              October 2014


   Subsequent requests from that user agent can be expected to contain
   the following header field if and only if both the requested resource
   and the resource in the top-level browsing context match the cookie.

2.  Terminology and notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].

   Two sequences of octets are said to case-insensitively match each
   other if and only if they are equivalent under the "i;ascii-casemap"
   collation defined in [RFC4790].

   The terms "active document", and "top-level browsing context" are
   defined in the HTML Living Standard.  [HTML]

   The term "origin" and the mechanism of deriving an origin from a URI
   are defined in [RFC6454].

2.1.  First-party and Third-party Requests

   The URL displayed in a user agent's address bar is the only security
   context directly exposed to users, and therefore the only signal
   users can reasonably rely upon to determine who they're talking to.

   Broadly speaking, then, a "first-party" request is an HTTP request
   for a resource whose URL's origin matches the origin of the URL the
   user sees in the address bar.  A "third-party" request is an HTTP
   request for a resource at any other origin.

   To be slightly more precise, given an HTTP request "request":

   1.  Let "context" be the top-level browsing context in the window
       responsible for "request".

   2.  Let "top-origin" be the origin of the location of the active
       document in "context".

   3.  If the origin of "request"'s URL is the same as "top-origin",
       "request" is a *first-party request*. Otherwise, "request" is a
       *third-party request*.

   Note that we deal with the document's _location_ in step 2 above, not
   with its effective origin.  For example, a top-level document from

Internet-Draft             first-party-cookies              October 2014


   "https://example.com" which has been sandboxed into a unique origin
   still creates a non-unique first-party context for subsequent
   requests.

   This definition has a few implications:

   o  New windows create new first-party contexts.

   o  Full-page navigations create new first-party contexts.  Notably,
      this includes both HTTP and "<meta>"-driven redirects.

   o  "<iframe>"s do _not_ create new first-party contexts; their
      requests MUST be considered in the context of the origin of the
      URL the user actually sees in the user agent's address bar.

3.  Server Requirements

   This section describes extensions to [RFC6265] necessary to implement
   the server-side requirements of the "First-Party" attribute.

3.1.  Grammar

   Add "First-Party" to the list of accepted attributes in the "Set-
   Cookie" header field's value by replacing the "cookie-av" token
   definition in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC6265] with the following ABNF
   grammar:

   cookie-av         = expires-av / max-age-av / domain-av /
                       path-av / secure-av / httponly-av /
                       first-party-av / extension-av
   first-party-av    = "First-Party"

3.2.  Semantics of the "First-Party" Attribute (Non-Normative)

   The "First-Party" attribute limits the scope of the cookie such that
   it will only be attached to requests if those requests are "first-
   party", as described in Section 2.1.  For example, requests for
   "https://example.com/sekrit-image" will attach first-party cookies if
   and only if the top-level browsing context is currently displaying a
   document from "https://example.com".

   The changes to the "Cookie" header field suggested in Section 4.3
   provide additional detail.

4.  User Agent Requirements

   This section describes extensions to [RFC6265] necessary in order to
   implement the client-side requirements of the "First-Party"
   attribute.

4.1.  The "First-Party" attribute

   The following attribute definition should be considered part of the
   the "Set-Cookie" algorithm as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6265]:

   If the attribute-name case-insensitively matches the string "First-
   Party", the user agent MUST append an attribute to the "cookie-
   attribute-list" with an "attribute-name" of "First-Party" and an
   empty "attribute-value".

4.2.  Monkey-patching the Storage Model

   Note: There's got to be a better way to specify this.  Until I figure
   out what that is, monkey-patching!

   Alter Section 5.3 of [RFC6265] as follows:

   1.  Add "firstparty-flag" to the list of fields stored for each
       cookie.

   2.  Before step 11 of the current algorithm, add the following:

       1.  If the "cookie-attribute-list" contains an attribute with an
           "attribute-name" of "First-Party", set the cookie's "first-
           party-flag" to true.  Otherwise, set the cookie's "first-
           party-flag" to false.

4.3.  Monkey-patching the "Cookie" header

   Note: There's got to be a better way to specify this.  Until I figure
   out what that is, monkey-patching!

   Alter Section 5.4 of [RFC6265] as follows:

   1.  Add the following requirement to the list in step 1:

       *  If the cookie's "first-party-flag" is true, then exclude the
          cookie if the HTTP request is a third-party request (see
          Section 2.1).

   Note that the modifications suggested here concern themselves only
   with the origin of the top-level browsing context and the origin of

   the resource being requested.  The cookie's "domain", "path", and
   "secure" attributes do not come into play for this comparison.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO.

   The first-party cookie concept documented here is similar to (but
   stricter than) Mark Goodwin's and Joe Walker's [samedomain-cookies].
